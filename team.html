          Abby is a freshman Computer Science student at UTDallas.
          While WEHack is not her first hackathon, she has learned much that she
          would not have if not for participating in WEHack. Abby enjoys playing
          games, listening to music, and trying new things. She is familiar with
          Java, C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Python. In the past, Abby worked
          on her high school robotics team for her last two years of high school,
           and she is excited to continue working with robotics throughout her
          college career through learning opportunities such as WEHack.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ashleigh is a junior CS student and recent transfer to UTD.
          She enjoys reading, gaming, and challenges (like WEHack)!
          While this is her second hackathon, sheâ€™s learned a lot about Python,
          JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and how each language can lend itself to the
           robotics industry. Ashleigh has a newfound interest in robotics thanks
            to WEHack and plans to go buy an Arduino kit to play with after WEHack ends.
        </p>

        <p>
          Natalie is a senior CS student, with a bit of experience in machine learning
          and database construction. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Rosie is a junior CS student, currently interested in the education field.
          She's involved with the young WISE mentorship program and UTeach. Rosie
          likes the team aspect of hackathons, as they present a complex challenge
          not only in regards to programming, but communication as well. WEHack has
          shown Rosie the complexities behind computer networking (especially proxy servers)
          and given her some newfound inspiration. Thanks SWE!
