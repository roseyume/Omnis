        <p>
        When beginning the brainstorming phase of our WEHack project,
        our team debated over multiple ideas that we thought would be viable as well as useful. As a team, we
        wanted to create something that would help future UTD students navigate college life.
        We initially thought to create a robot for the platform Discord, but with some direction from a mentor,
        we decided to take our project in another direction. We maintained that we wanted to create a bot,
        but it would instead be related to assisting those who wanted to navigate the the numerous UTDallas academic websites.
        Instead of spending hours webcrawling for hidden info within UTD sites, we planned to make a bot that could parse
        these sites for you, and return a quick and easy answer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once we finalized our idea, we contemplated how to approach its implementation. There were
          hundreds of chatbbot tutorials in dozens of programming languages, each using different libraries
          and implementations. We also needed a chatbot that could grab data off the internet, or in this case,
          Google.com. We decided to use the language Python for its data analysis and scraping possibilities,
          which could help us when making the robot respond using data it found.
          We researched different methods of implementing a chatbot using Python,
          and once we found a method we thought would work best for our project,
          we began implementation using a quick start tutorial.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, following the tutorial was not nearly as simple as it seemed.
          Because the tutorial was written with Linux users in mind, and most of us were using Apple/Microsoft software,
          there were certain areas where we needed to perform more research to truly grasp what our next step in the program was.
          We had to research ports and how they corresponded with the python server we built to
          parse web entries.
          We also had to make a few changes to the foundation provided by the tutorial, and then we had to format these changes
          for Python. Python's strict indentation rules proved to be more tricky than expected. Especially when trying
          link our application the front page of our website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The debugging was ruthless process, but not nearly as challenging as what followed. Next we needed to figure out the
          front end development associated with our webpage (or more specifically our chat bot). We spent the entire night
          lerning about http servers, response headers, and proxy servers using node.js. After the help of several mentors and
          stack exchange forums, we finally started to get somewhere. We went from slightly erronous (but existent) responses
          to an actual correct answer within our text bubble!
